# Project State

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Compute pivoted from ECS Fargate to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime (managed; no ALB/VPC/NAT/PrivateLink in scope).
- Initialization: Vector store is S3 Vectors (cost-driven over OpenSearch Serverless).
- Initialization: IaC is Terraform `~> 6.27` primary; hybrid Terraform + CDK/CLI fallback for AgentCore if provider has gaps — decision locks in Phase 3 planning.
- Initialization: Region is `ap-northeast-1` prod / `us-east-1` dev.
- Initialization: Workshop docs trail system implementation — Phase 5 follows Phases 1-4 because docs need real screenshots and verified snippets.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 3 open questions** (from research/SUMMARY.md): AgentCore Terraform-provider coverage, AgentCore pricing model, exact Pipecat → AgentCore deploy steps, concurrency/quota defaults, WebRTC-vs-WebSocket transport for Pipecat. Resolve in Phase 3 planning via `/gsd-research-phase` before committing implementation.
